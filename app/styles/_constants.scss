 ******************************************************************************
 * COMMON STYLES
 * *Please* put all shared styling information here in a single place.
 * This includes but is not limited to:
 *   - Text styles
 *   - Variables for colors
 *   - Variables for dimensions such as common grid/ui elements
 *   - Variables for CSS easing equations (so we can achieve consistency
 *     in our animation appearances)
 *   - Variables for CSS transition/animation durations
 *
 * Please follow standard CSS naming conventions, i.e. all lower-case
 * with hyphens.  When in doubt or brainfarting while trying to think of
 * what to call something, you can always refer to the Compass.org
 * styles to see how they name their variables, mixins, and functions:
