# Ken Hunt

Ken Hunt is an HTML5 game I built as a joke for one of my friends on his birthday. This is a modified version. The original version contains elements that may not be suitable for work and jokes that would need too much explaining. It also contained many more commits.

You can play the game here. http://hexrays.at/stuff/kenhunt/
